Updated Decrypted Text:
because the practice of the basic movements of kata is
the focus and mastery of self is the essence of
matsubayashi ryu karate do i shall try to elucidate the
movements of the kata according to my interpretation
based on forty years of study
it is not an easy task to explain each movement and its
significance and some must remain unexplained to give a
complete explanation one would have to be qualified and
inspired to such an extent that he could reach the state
of enlightened mind capable of recognizing soundless
sound and shapeless shape i do not deem myself the final
authority but my experience with kata has left no doubt
that the following is the proper application and
interpretation i offer my theories in the hope that the
essence of okinawan karate will remain intact

## 1.1 Decryption Strategy

I mapped out the letter frequencies in the English language and analyzed the letter frequencies in the ciphertext. Based on these frequencies, I swapped the characters in the ciphertext accordingly. Finally, I allowed for manual adjustments to the swapped text, enabling corrections when words were recognizable but had one or two misplaced letters.

Shift 11:
ifweallunitewewillcausetheriverstostainthegreatwate
rswiththeirblood

"if we all unite we will cause the rivers to stain the great waters
with their blood" - Tecumseh

## 1.2 Decryption Strategy

Given that the problem stated the ciphertext was encrypted with a shift, I assumed it was a Caesar Shift. I wrote a program that accepted a shift number and the ciphertext, then returned the decrypted text. Since the encoded string was relatively short, I implemented a loop to try all 25 possible shifts. Afterward, I analyzed the outputs for recognizable English words. It became evident that the Caesar Shift used a shift of 11, as the name "Tecumseh" became immediately clear.

## 1.11 Affine Cipher Decryption

Decryption result: firstthesentenceandthentheevidencesaidthequeen

With some spaces: "First the sentence and then the evidence said the queen"
